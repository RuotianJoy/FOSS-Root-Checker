<div align="center">

FOSS ROOT Checker as the name suggests is an `Open Source` Root Checker app for verifying `ROOT Access` on Android Mobile Devices. Ever wondered what Root Checker Apps do behind the scenes on your Phones once you give them ROOT Access?

Well that's why I made this App! It is just a simple Root Checker for Newbies but with Transparency of what is done.

App Version : `v1.0`

Package ID : `foss.chillastro.su`

Requirements : `Android Pie and Higher`

Currently in Development. Releasing in March! 🌟

To be Released on Amazon App Store, UptoDown Store, APKPure and FDroid.

## How it works? 

The **FOSS Root Checker** employs a dual-layered verification strategy to determine system integrity without compromising your privacy:

1. **Functional Execution Check:** The app attempts to spawn a shell process to run the `su -c id` command. If the system returns a User ID of `0`, the app confirms that active SuperUser execution privileges are granted.
2. **Filesystem Signature Scan:** As a secondary fallback, the app performs a manual search through high-priority system paths (such as `/system/xbin/`, `/sbin/`, and `/data/local/`) for the presence of a standalone `su` binary.

By combining these methods, the app accurately detects root access across both legacy environments (Android 9/10) and modern implementations like **Magisk**, **KernelSU**, and **APatch**. All checks are performed on a background thread (`Dispatchers.IO`) to ensure your device remains responsive during the scan.
